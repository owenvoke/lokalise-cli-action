  with:
  # ...
```

## Usage

This action has various configurable inputs. These are documented below:

### `command`

This is the command that you would like to run. This should exclude the `lokalise2` binary, as well as the `--token`
and `--config` options.

For example:

```yml
with:
  command: team
```

### `config`

This is an **optional** path to a Lokalise config file. By default, this will be excluded as it is not necessary.

(or [following their help guide](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/1929556)).

## Treeware

You're free to use this package, but if it makes it to your production environment you are required to buy the world a
tree.

It’s now common knowledge that one of the best tools to tackle the climate crisis and keep our temperatures from rising
above 1.5C is to plant trees. If you support this package and contribute to the Treeware forest you’ll be creating
employment for local families and restoring wildlife habitats.

You can buy trees [here][link-treeware-gifting].
